# MineHelm project
This README is temporary and aims to explain the project goals.

MineHelm is supposed to be a minecraft server network administration dashboard which allows creation of single server instances with multiple engines, as well as proxies with auto-scaling enabled.
It will support docker for single-node environments and kuberentes for multi-node ones.

Currently, most popular solution for those kinds of applications is probably [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) which is nice, however It lacks some of the features we want, like nice API for creation
of new resources/instances, possible billing/resource limits, server autoscaling, external integrations, routing and some more.

This project is ambitious, and that's why It will probably take us some time to release alpha version. Thanks for your patience ðŸ¥°.
